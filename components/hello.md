**Hi** I am a graduate student currently completing my *Masters in Software Engineering* at University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. I am a developer and a photographer.

Currently, I am exploring ~~[GO](https://golang.org), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and [React](https://reactjs.org)~~ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) in my spare time. This website was built using React, Typescript,[Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). 

Below, you will find a list of personal/school projects that i've worked on over the last couple years.

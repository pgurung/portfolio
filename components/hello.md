**Hi** I am a Software Engineer. In my spare time I like to explore new programming languages, go hiking, and take pictures.

I am currently exploring the Rust progamming language.
I also recently acquired some film cameras. So, i've been shooting a lot of film in my spare time. You can follow along my creative adventures on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pranamgurung/)
